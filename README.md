Discord Bot for New World Dry Tree Server Status

To use on different servers, apply hints in the comments.

Make sure the bot has admin rights. Less might be also needed but did not check which exact permissions are needed.

To run:

```python3 bot.py```

Not optimised at all but does the job.

Only tested on Python 3.8.10.
